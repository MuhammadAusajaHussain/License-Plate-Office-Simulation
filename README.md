# License Plate Office Simulation

This project models and compares two customer handling systems in an automotive license plate office using **Arena Simulation Software**. The aim is to analyze customer flow and identify which configuration offers better performance in terms of average and maximum time spent in the system.

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Overview

### Simulation 1:  
- **Setup:** 3 independent arrival streams (Exp(10 mins))  
- **Stage 1:** 3 dedicated clerks with separate queues (UNIF(8, 10) mins service time)  
- **Stage 2:** Shared clerk for all (UNIF(2.65, 3.33) mins service time)  
- **Queue Type:** Separated by customer type at first stage

### Simulation 2:  
- **Setup:** Combined single queue  
- **Stage 1:** 3 flexible clerks serving all customers  
- **Stage 2:** Same shared clerk as Simulation 1  
- **Queue Type:** Single, shared queue for all customers

Both simulations are run for a **single replication of 5,000 minutes**.

## ðŸ“Š Objective

To compare the **average** and **maximum** time in the system for all customer types and evaluate which system performs better under similar arrival and service conditions.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- [Arena Simulation Software](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/products/software/arena-simulation.html)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the `.doe` file using Arena.
2. Click "Run" to simulate the 5,000-minute scenario.
3. Check the generated `.pdf` report for performance statistics.
4. Open `Analysis Report.docx` for conclusions and comparison between the two systems.

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

- Results are based on a single replication; multiple replications can be used for more statistically accurate analysis.
- Text boxes in Arena models contain key statistics like average and maximum time in system.
